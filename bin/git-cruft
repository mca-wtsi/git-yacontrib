##### things to list, in priority order
#
### sync state, wrt. each remote
#
# tags not yet pushed (NET:READ)
# tags not matching pushed state (NET:READ)
# >> list all refs (tags, branches, stashes), to be diffed later after refetch
#
# branches not yet pushed (no remote)
# branches not pushed up-to-date (ahead of/behind remote)
#
# local branches lagging their remote (NET:READ)
#
### local things pointing at the checkout (some heuristics, not the Halting Problem)
#
# git config --get-regexp ^plumbed-in\\.  # like our ./install.sh
# PATH or other %ENV elements
# crontab
# dotfiles (directly under ~/ or maybe one dir down)
# profile / login
# ~/public_html/
#
### local state
#
# git-notes(1), refs/notes/*  https://git-scm.com/blog/2010/08/25/notes.html
# git-replace(1), refs/replace/
# stashes
#
# staged
# modified
# untracked
# ignored
#
# non-standard permissions (anything that looks like it is not the result of a "git checkout")
# differences in .git/
#   config
#   info/grafts
#
# some flag to show it should be encrypted, vs. not being under encfs or /dev/mapper/luks-*
